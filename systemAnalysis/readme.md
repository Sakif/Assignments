# Lab 1
Starting from the first lab we practice C++ programming. The first tasks will be very simple and then me move the more complicated tasks.

You are encouraged to participate and practice and ask questions to me and out TAs.

## Task 1

Create a program which takes a positive integer number N as an input. The program needs to output Fibonacci numbers F(1), F(2), ..., F(N)

For example:

N=5

Output: 1,1,2,3,5

--------------

N=8

Output: 1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21

## Task 2

Create a program which takes a positive integer number N as an input. The program needs to output all prime factors of this number. In other words, the software needs to perform prime factorization of N.

For example:

N=5

Output: 5

--------------

N=8

Output: 2,2,2

--------------

N=20

Output: 2,2,5

Once most of the people complete a task a solution will be posted.

# Lab 2
## Task 1

Create a program which takes an integer m as an input and outputs prime number number m. For example:

for m = 1 output 2

for m = 2 output 3

for m = 3 output 5 etc.

## Task 2

You are given a file student.txt which contains student records. The first row contains the number of records. The latter rows contains records themselves in the form

Name

Family name

GPA

U for undergraduate/ or G for graduate

F for female/ M for male

ID number

(no empty rows)

An example of file is attached (TBD). Your task, read the file and count how many undergraduate students are there, and how many females.

## Task 3

Create a program which performs prime number decomposition (as in lab 1), but uses a recursive function which calls itself, but with smaller parameter values.
